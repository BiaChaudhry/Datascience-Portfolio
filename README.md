# Data Science & Data Analytics Projects

## Project # 1: Data Explainiability Challenge 
Technolvers launched the #Data Explainability Challenge (DEC) to emphasize the importance of Data Science and Data Analytics for tackling real-world problems like the current COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were required to rank the top five regions of Pakistan from the Most Successful to the Most Struggling on the basis of the provided COVID-19 dataset.
Our team consisting of three members (Farhana Shafi, Rahat Ul Ain, Bia Chaudhry (Team Lead)), performed data analysis in four major steps. First, we implemented a time-series analysis to examine the region-wise trends of several factors. Then, we compared all the regions considering parameter ratios. Third, we drew insights from previous comparisons. And finally, we rated the top five regions.  #Alhumdullilah. We stood second runner-up in this all Pakistan DEC competition. Special thanks to Dr.Semaab Latif for mentoring us.
