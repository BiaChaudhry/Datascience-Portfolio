## Project # 1: Data Explainiability Challenge

Technolvers launched the #Data Explainability Challenge (DEC) to emphasize the importance of Data Science and Data Analytics for tackling real-world problems like the current COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were required to rank the top five regions of Pakistan from the Most Successful to the Most Struggling on the basis of the provided COVID-19 dataset.
Our team consisting of three members (Farhana Shafi, Rahat Ul Ain, Bia Chaudhry (Team Lead)), performed data analysis in four major steps. First, we implemented a time-series analysis to examine the region-wise trends of several factors. Then, we compared all the regions considering parameter ratios. Third, we drew insights from previous comparisons. And finally, we rated the top five regions.  #Alhumdullilah. We stood second runner-up in this all Pakistan DEC competition. Special thanks to Dr.Semaab Latif for mentoring us.

## Project # 2: Reading Habit Analysis

I collected and analysed the data for getting the answer to the question: "What Motivates you to read?". I applied **Clustering & Decision Tree** approach to generate results. The details can be found in my medium blog: [Reading Habit Analysis - Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@biach1312/reading-habit-analysis-895f78865bb0). I used Kaggle kernel for the analysis. The source code can be found on Kaggle. [Source Code](https://www.kaggle.com/biach1312/kernel-reading-habit-analysis). You are very welcome to use the dataset as well as improve these results. It can be used to create an **End-to-End** system to motivate users to read.

## Project # 3: Similarity between Documents

Using **NLP** techniques I found the similarity between several documents. The processes I used include: 
  1. TF-IDF
  2. Cosine-similarity
  3. Soft-Cosine-Similarity
  4. Fasttext Word Embeddings
  5. Clustering : Dendograms
  6. Visualization : Network Graph
  7. Evaluation Metric : Accuracy
The detailed code with further explanation can be found here: [Code & Description](https://github.com/BiaChaudhry/Document_Similarity_NLP/blob/master/NLP_Project_Bia_Chaudhry_184055_SimilarityBetweenDocuments.ipynb)
